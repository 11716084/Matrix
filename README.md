# Matrix
Program that does the following:

1.Prints a menu consisting of 4 options. The example shows what the menu should look like.

2.Reads the user's choice.

3.Reads all data (matrices, constants) needed to perform the chosen operation. The example shows the input format in each case.

4.Calculates the result and outputs it. The example shows how your output should look like.

5.Repeats all these steps.

Example

(The greater-than symbol followed by a space (> ) represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the input.)
1. Add matrices
2. Multiply matrix by a constant
3. Multiply matrices
0. Exit
Your choice: > 1

Enter size of first matrix: > 4 5

Enter first matrix:

> 1 2 3 4 5

> 3 2 3 2 1

> 8 0 9 9 1

> 1 3 4 5 6

Enter size of second matrix: > 4 5
Enter second matrix:
> 1 1 4 4 5

> 4 4 5 7 8

> 1 2 3 9 8

> 1 0 0 0 1

The result is:

2 3 7 8 10

7 6 8 9 9

9 2 12 18 9

2 3 4 5 7
